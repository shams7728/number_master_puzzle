# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature creates a generic, reusable level progression system that can be integrated into any game. The system provides a flexible, strategy-based approach to level advancement that supports multiple progression rules (grid completion, sublevels, XP accumulation, etc.) and can be easily extended for custom game mechanics. The system is decoupled from specific game logic and provides event-driven updates for UI and state management.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a game developer, I want a flexible level system that can handle different progression rules, so that I can easily adapt it to various game types without rewriting core logic.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is initialized THEN it SHALL accept multiple progression strategies simultaneously
2. WHEN a progression strategy is added THEN the system SHALL evaluate all strategies before advancing levels
3. WHEN custom progression rules are needed THEN the system SHALL allow new strategies to be implemented through a standard interface
4. IF multiple strategies are configured THEN the system SHALL require ALL strategies to be satisfied before level advancement

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a game developer, I want the level system to be decoupled from my game logic, so that I can integrate it into any game without tight coupling.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN game events occur THEN the system SHALL receive them through a generic event interface
2. WHEN the system needs to communicate state changes THEN it SHALL emit events that can be observed by any listener
3. WHEN integrating with a new game THEN the system SHALL not require knowledge of specific game mechanics
4. IF the game has custom events THEN the system SHALL handle them through the generic event forwarding mechanism

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a game developer, I want built-in support for common progression patterns, so that I don't have to implement basic level mechanics from scratch.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using grid-based games THEN the system SHALL provide a grid completion strategy
2. WHEN using sublevel-based progression THEN the system SHALL track sublevel completion with configurable counts per level
3. WHEN using XP-based progression THEN the system SHALL accumulate experience points with configurable thresholds per level
4. WHEN combining progression types THEN the system SHALL support multiple strategies working together

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a game developer, I want to track and persist level progress, so that players can resume their progress across game sessions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN level progress changes THEN the system SHALL provide a snapshot of current state
2. WHEN the system is initialized THEN it SHALL accept initial state to restore previous progress
3. WHEN metadata is updated THEN the system SHALL emit events containing the updated progress snapshot
4. IF custom metadata is needed THEN the system SHALL support arbitrary key-value metadata storage

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a game developer, I want easy configuration and setup, so that I can quickly integrate the level system without complex initialization code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN setting up the level system THEN it SHALL provide a factory pattern for simple configuration
2. WHEN configuring strategies THEN it SHALL accept configuration objects rather than requiring manual strategy instantiation
3. WHEN starting a new game THEN it SHALL allow specification of starting level and initial metadata
4. IF default configurations are sufficient THEN the system SHALL work with minimal setup code

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a game developer, I want real-time updates about level progress, so that I can update UI and game state immediately when progress changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN level advancement occurs THEN the system SHALL emit a level advanced event with from/to level information
2. WHEN progress metadata changes THEN the system SHALL emit metadata changed events
3. WHEN sublevel progress updates THEN the system SHALL emit sublevel progress events with completion counts
4. WHEN XP changes THEN the system SHALL emit XP changed events with current and threshold values
5. IF multiple listeners are registered THEN the system SHALL notify all listeners of events

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a game developer, I want type-safe level identifiers, so that I can avoid bugs related to invalid level references.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN working with levels THEN the system SHALL use strongly-typed level identifiers
2. WHEN creating level identifiers THEN the system SHALL validate that level values are non-negative
3. WHEN advancing levels THEN the system SHALL provide safe level progression methods
4. IF invalid level operations are attempted THEN the system SHALL prevent them through type safety

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a game developer, I want the system to be extensible, so that I can add custom progression strategies for unique game mechanics.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing custom strategies THEN the system SHALL provide a clear strategy interface
2. WHEN custom strategies are created THEN they SHALL integrate seamlessly with existing strategies
3. WHEN strategy behavior needs customization THEN the system SHALL provide access to progress context and metadata
4. IF new event types are needed THEN custom strategies SHALL be able to respond to any game event string
